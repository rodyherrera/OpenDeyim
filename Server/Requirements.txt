# * The OpenDeyim Source Code
# * A free, modern, self-hosted and open source translation service that instantly 
# * translates phrases, words and web pages into more than 30 languages. Use our 
# * API or bindings and experiment with OpenDeyim.
# * 
# * For more information, please read the documentation inside 
# * the <README.md> file which is located at the root of this directory or source code.
# * 
# * Consider that, OpenDeyim, has parts of the LibreTranslate source code, despite 
# * the fact that it has been rewritten from scratch, removing functionalities from the 
# * original backend, reducing it to only one API under Flask, however, OpenDeyim, as 
# * of its publication, is completely misaligned With updates or implementations that 
# * LibreTranslate eventually receives, OpenDeyim does not claim to be a copy of it.
